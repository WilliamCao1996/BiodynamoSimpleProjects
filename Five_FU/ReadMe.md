# Five_FU
5-FU is a type of chemical drug.

At some concentrations it inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells, while at others it promotes the proliferation of cancer cells.

You may set the concentration of 5-FU in the src/Five_FU.h file.

This simulation starts with 10000 cancer cells.

This simulation goes on for 72 timesteps, representing 72 hours.

The programme will output the number of remaining cancer cells at 24 hours and 72 hours.
