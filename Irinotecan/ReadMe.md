Irinotecan is a type of chemical drug.

At some concentrations it inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells, while at others it promotes the proliferation of cancer cells.

This simulation starts with 10000 cancer cells.

This simulation goes on for 72 timesteps, representing 72 hours.

The programme will output the number of remaining cancer cells at 24 hours and 72 hours.

Irinotecan may decay over time. In the src/Irinotecan.h file you may change the initial concentration of the drug.

Perhaps in short time scale it has a concentration high enough to kill cells, in long time scale it changes to a low concentration and promote cell proliferation.
